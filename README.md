# Mountain Shelter
This is my internship project in Capgemini Software Solutions Centre, NSC SAP Technologies. My main goal is to make fullstack application for reservations in mountain shelter using CAP, SAPUI5, JavaScript and HANA database.

## Installation
Make sure you have NPM installed. You will also have to install CLIs: CDS and HANA-CLI

``` npm i -g @sap/cds-dk ```

``` npm i -g hana-cli ```

Then install all project dependencies:

``` npm install ```

To run this project run it in hybrid mode (remote DB + local service for application):

``` cds watch --profile hybrid ```
